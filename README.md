# Android-Testing-Interview-Question-Answer

**1. What is Manual and Automated Testing ?**

*manual Testing*

  Manual testing is the process in which QA analysts execute tests one-by-one in an individual manner. 
  The purpose of manual testing is to catch bugs and feature issues before a software application goes live.
  When manually testing, the tester validates the key features of a software application. 
  Analysts execute test cases and develop summary error reports without specialized automation tools. 

  How Manual Testing Works
  Manual testing is very hands-on. It requires analysts and QA engineers to be highly involved in everything from test 
  case creation to actual test execution. 
  
*Automated Testing*

  Automation testing is the process in which testers utilize tools and scripts to automate testing efforts.
  Automation testing helps testers execute more test cases and improve test coverage. 
  When comparing manual vs. automation testing, manual takes longer. Automated testing is more efficient.
  
  How Automated Testing Works
  Automation testing involves testers writing test scripts that automate test execution. (A test script is a set of instructions 
  to be performed on target platforms to validate a feature or expected outcome.)
